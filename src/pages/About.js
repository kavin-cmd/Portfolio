        <p>
        As a Data Analyst at CGI, I have leveraged Python and Pandas for comprehensive data preprocessing, ensuring datasets are clean, normalized, and ready for in-depth analysis. My expertise in Apache Spark has enabled efficient management and processing of large-scale data, improving processing speed by 30% and ensuring high performance and scalability. I have developed interactive dashboards and detailed reports using Power BI and DAX, enhancing real-time and historical data visualization for stakeholders, which led to a 25% increase in decision-making efficiency. Additionally, I created and optimized predictive models with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to accurately forecast equipment failures, enhancing operational efficiency. I executed complex SQL queries for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading, and managed ETL processes to consolidate data into a unified format, reducing processing time by 40%. My role also involved implementing Prometheus for robust system monitoring and utilizing Grafana for dynamic performance visualization.
        <br></br>
        During my tenure at Yash Enterprise, I employed Python and NumPy for data manipulation and mathematical operations, which streamlined data analysis processes and enhanced predictive modeling tasks. I spearheaded the transition from client-side analysis using MS SQL to utilizing extended events, which improved data accuracy and insights. I led the implementation of extended events on SQL Server, collaborating with the tracing team to enhance data collection and analysis capabilities. Additionally, I developed a customer segmentation algorithm using R, which increased market share by 22% through targeted marketing strategies. My work with logistic regression models achieved over 98% prediction accuracy for product sales, supporting strategic business decisions and effective inventory management.
